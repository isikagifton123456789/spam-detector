# Placeholder for logistic regression model
# This file will be created when you train your spam detection model
# 
# To create this file, you would typically:
# 1. Load and preprocess your email dataset
# 2. Train a LogisticRegression model
# 3. Save the trained model using pickle
#
# Example training code:
# import pickle
# from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
# 
# # After training your model...
# with open('logistic_model.pkl', 'wb') as f:
#     pickle.dump(trained_model, f)

# This is a placeholder file - replace with actual trained model
